### 2. Required APIs

1.  **Frontend (Browser-side):**
    *   `File API`: For handling user-uploaded image files.
    *   `MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()`: A browser API to let the user capture their screen content (for on-screen graphs).

2.  **Backend (Server-side):**
    *   **FastAPI Endpoints:**
        *   `POST /api/analyze/upload`: Accepts an image file, processes it, and returns insights.
        *   `POST /api/analyze/screencap`: Accepts a base64 encoded screen capture, processes it, and returns insights.
    *   **Database Interface:** An ORM like SQLAlchemy to communicate with the PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving historical data.

3.  **External AI API:**
    *   **Google Gemini API:** Specifically, the `gemini-pro-vision` model for multimodal input (text prompt + image). We will use the official `google-generativeai` Python SDK.

### 3. Flow of Data

This details the step-by-step process from user action to final output.

**Step 1: Image Input**
*   The user either uploads a graph image (e.g., a `.png` or `.jpg` file) or uses the screen capture feature to select a portion of their screen containing a chart.
*   The frontend converts the image into a suitable format (e.g., `multipart/form-data` for upload or a base64 string for a screencap) and sends it to the backend via an API call.

**Step 2: Initial Insight Generation**
*   The backend server receives the image.
*   It constructs a carefully engineered prompt to send to the Gemini API along with the image. This prompt instructs the model to act as a data analyst.
*   The backend sends the image and the prompt to the `gemini-pro-vision` model.

**Step 3: Raw Insight Parsing**
*   Gemini processes the image and text prompt, returning a structured response (we'll request JSON format). This response includes:
    *   Extracted data points (e.g., `{"Month": "Jan", "Sales": 100}`).
    *   An explanation of trends and patterns.
    *   Identification of any anomalies.
    *   A list of initial, unvalidated recommendations.

**Step 4: Data Validation & Refinement**
*   The backend's **Validation Engine** takes the structured data extracted by Gemini.
*   It queries the PostgreSQL database for historical data relevant to the metrics identified in the chart (e.g., "Sales" data from previous months).
*   The engine then constructs a **second, validation-focused prompt** for Gemini. This prompt includes:
    *   The initial insights and recommendations generated in Step 3.
    *   The historical data retrieved from the database.
    *   An instruction: *"Based on the provided historical data, validate, refine, or challenge the initial insights. Ensure all final recommendations are backed by evidence from the combined new and historical data."*
*   This second call ensures that the AI's conclusions aren't just based on a single image but are grounded in a larger context.

**Step 5: Storing New Data**
*   The validated data points extracted from the new graph are stored in the PostgreSQL database, enriching the historical dataset for future analyses.

**Step 6: Final Response to User**
*   The refined, validated, and evidence-backed insights are formatted into a clear, human-readable format.
*   The backend sends this final JSON response back to the frontend.
*   The UI displays the explanation, trends, and actionable recommendations to the user.

### 4. Sample Code Snippet (Python/FastAPI + Gemini)

This snippet demonstrates the core logic for interacting with the Gemini Vision API for graph understanding.

```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai
import PIL.Image
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# --- Configuration ---
# Load API key from environment variables for security
GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
if not GEMINI_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set.")
    
genai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)

app = FastAPI()

# --- Pydantic Models for structured data ---
class InsightResponse(BaseModel):
    chart_type: str
    summary: str
    trends: list[str]
    anomalies: list[str]
    recommendations: list[str]
    extracted_data: list[dict]

# --- Core Gemini Logic ---
async def analyze_graph_with_gemini(image: PIL.Image.Image):
    """
    Sends an image of a graph to Gemini and gets structured insights.
    This is the first pass analysis.
    """
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro-vision')

    # This prompt is engineered to get a structured JSON output.
    prompt = """
    You are an expert data analyst. Analyze the provided chart image.
    Respond in a valid JSON format with the following keys:
    - "chart_type": (e.g., "Line Chart", "Bar Chart", "Pie Chart")
    - "summary": A brief, one-sentence summary of the chart's main point.
    - "trends": A list of key trends or patterns observed.
    - "anomalies": A list of any outliers or unexpected data points.
    - "recommendations": A list of 2-3 actionable business recommendations based ONLY on the data in this chart.
    - "extracted_data": An array of JSON objects representing the data points. For example, [{"category": "Jan", "value": 150}, {"category": "Feb", "value": 170}].

    Here is the chart:
    """

    try:
        response = await model.generate_content_async([prompt, image])
        # In a real app, you'd add robust JSON parsing and error handling here
        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Gemini API call failed: {str(e)}")


@app.post("/api/analyze/upload", response_model=InsightResponse)
async def analyze_uploaded_graph(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    """
    Endpoint to analyze a user-uploaded graph image.
    In a full implementation, this would also trigger the validation step.
    """
    if not file.content_type.startswith("image/"):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="File provided is not an image.")

    image_content = await file.read()
    image = PIL.Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_content))

    # --- Step 1 & 2: Get initial analysis from Gemini ---
    raw_insights_json_str = await analyze_graph_with_gemini(image)

    # --- Step 3: Parse the insights (add validation here) ---
    # For this snippet, we assume the JSON is valid.
    # In production, use a try-except block and a JSON validation library.
    initial_insights = json.loads(raw_insights_json_str)
    
    # --- Step 4 & 5 (Conceptual): Validation & Data Storage ---
    # extracted_data = initial_insights.get("extracted_data", [])
    # historical_data = query_database_for_history(extracted_data)
    # validated_insights = call_gemini_for_validation(initial_insights, historical_data)
    # store_new_data_in_db(extracted_data)
    # return validated_insights

    # For this snippet, we return the initial insights directly.
    return InsightResponse(**initial_insights)

```

### 5. Backend Design (Data Validation & History)

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy (ORM)

**Database Schema:**
A simple schema to store time-series data extracted from graphs.

```sql
CREATE TABLE graph_data_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'Monthly Sales', 'User Signups'
    category VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    -- e.g., 'January', 'Q1 2023', 'Product A'
    value NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    extracted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    source_graph_hash VARCHAR(64) -- A hash of the image file to avoid duplicates
);

CREATE INDEX idx_metric_name_category ON graph_data_history (metric_name, category);
```

**Validation Logic (Python - Conceptual):**

```python
# This function would be part of your backend logic
def get_validated_insights(initial_insights: dict, db_session) -> dict:
    extracted_data = initial_insights.get("extracted_data", [])
    if not extracted_data:
        return initial_insights # Cannot validate without data

    # 1. Query DB for relevant historical data
    metric_name = "sales" # This should be inferred from the chart title/labels
    categories = [item['category'] for item in extracted_data]
    
    # Using SQLAlchemy to build a query
    historical_records = db_session.query(GraphDataHistory).filter(
        GraphDataHistory.metric_name == metric_name,
        GraphDataHistory.category.in_(categories)
    ).all()
    
    historical_data_str = json.dumps(
        [{"category": r.category, "value": r.value} for r in historical_records]
    )

    # 2. Construct the second, validation-focused prompt
    validation_model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro') # Text-only is fine here
    validation_prompt = f"""
    An initial analysis of a new chart produced these insights:
    {json.dumps(initial_insights)}

    Here is the relevant historical data for the same metrics from our database:
    {historical_data_str}

    Your task is to act as a senior auditor.
    1. Cross-check the "trends" and "anomalies" from the initial analysis against the historical data.
    2. Refine, confirm, or challenge the "recommendations". A recommendation is only valid if supported by both the new chart and the historical context.
    3. Return a final, validated JSON object with the same structure as the initial analysis, but with the refined content.
    """
    
    validation_response = validation_model.generate_content(validation_prompt)
    final_insights = json.loads(validation_response.text) # Add robust parsing

    return final_insights
```

### 6. Security Best Practices

1.  **API Key Management:**
    *   **NEVER** embed the Gemini API key in the frontend code.
    *   On the backend, load the API key from an environment variable (`os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")`) or a secure secret management service (like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault).

2.  **Data in Transit:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS/TLS on your FastAPI server using a reverse proxy like Nginx or a cloud load balancer. This encrypts all communication between the user's browser and your backend.

3.  **Data at Rest:**
    *   Use a managed database service (like Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL) that provides encryption at rest by default. This protects your stored historical data.

4.  **Input Sanitization:**
    *   While `gemini-pro-vision` is less susceptible to traditional text-based prompt injection through the image itself, always validate and sanitize any textual input that might accompany the image.
    *   Limit file upload size and accepted file types (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`) to prevent denial-of-service attacks or the uploading of malicious files.

5.  **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   For a production application, implement user authentication (e.g., using OAuth2 with JWTs). This ensures that only authorized users can access the service and allows you to associate historical data with specific users or teams.

This comprehensive design provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for an AI assistant that delivers genuinely useful, evidence-backed insights from visual data.
